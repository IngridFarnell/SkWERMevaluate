# SkWERMevaluate

To improve habitat models for priority wildlife species in the Skeena Region, current model predictions must be verified.

SkWERMevaluate is an R package developed to process the SkWERM habitat model, connect the model to different geographic layers of interest, that when combined drive the selection of sites for habitat model evaluation

This R package supports wildlife habitat modelling by importing model outputs (https://github.com/bcgov/SSGBM-VRI-BEM/tree/main with expert opinion), and interacting the model with additional habitat features that may modify scores. 

Polygons are then randomly selected to enable field assessments.
