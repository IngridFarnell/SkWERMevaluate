# SkWERMevaluate

To improve habitat models for priority wildlife species in the Skeena Region, current model predictions must be verified.

SkWERMevaluate is an R package developed to process the SkWERM habitat model (https://github.com/bcgov/SSGBM-VRI-BEM/tree/main with expert opinion), connect the model to different geographic layers of interest, and randomly select polygons for habitat model evaluation.

Install `SkWERMevaluate` from github.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aclason/SkWERMevaluate", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
