# SkWERMevaluate

To improve habitat models for priority wildlife species in the Skeena Region, current model predictions must be verified. This R package supports wildlife habitat modelling by importing model outputs (https://github.com/bcgov/SSGBM-VRI-BEM/tree/main with expert opinion), and interacting the model with additional habitat features that may modify scores. Polygons are then randomly selected to enable field assessments. 


The package will specifically select sites within the Lakes district TSA, but additional areas can be queried as needed.
